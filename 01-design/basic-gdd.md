# A Basic Game Development Document

I have been watching videos by [Steve Lee](https://www.youtube.com/@stevelee_gamedev) on game level design, after spending the past few months working with Unreal Engine.

Earlier today on Discord I was asked to help a user develop a game set in 3050, and he offered to send me the GDD. I had to first figure out what that was! But this lines up perfectly with two plans I have:

1) Practice level design with block outs/greybox/whitebox.
2) Put together some cool cyberpunk thing.

Now, still not sure if the 3050 game will be cyberpunk-ish, but it's a good start.

My current major project in Unreal is a medieval fantasy themed RPG. I totally had no plan going in when I started, and didn't find the RPG tutorial until AFTER I ahd already done a lot of work... though most of the stuff I've learned was from Gorka before he started the tutorial series.

After watching videos by Steve Lee, I was tempted to start desiging a game the right way: With scripting and blockouts.

## Main Idea

### Concept

The player wakes up alone in a sterile, futuristic lab room. They get up off the lab table and looking down, they realize they are a robot/cyborg.
(ok, part of my problem is that I want to stop now and open a game engine/level editor).

You are an AI who has been given a body and you have been designed for battle, but your creator/main programmer/trainer placed too much good in you. You don't want mass destruction, but you'll fight for freedom.
**very much wondering against creating a first person shooter (FPS) but it will likely come to that, But maybe more puzzle related like Tomb Raider.**

But I can't stress enough that you should be following [Gorka Games](https://www.youtube.com/@GorkaGames) and his RPG Tutorial for Unreal Engine.
