# Modding Skyrim

I started wanting to mod Skyrim seriously on July 17, 2023. Here is a log of my progression as I work towards possibly working on a level for the release of Skyblivion in 2025.

The first step in getting to work on Skyblivion is to complete all the Creation Kit tutorials on creationkit.com.

1) [Creation Kit Tutorial Series - Episode 1: Introduction to the Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKivlGmia4) - completed July 21, 2023
