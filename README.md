# Game Development and Design
This repo consists of notes and ideas and maybe even lessons relating to game design and game development. First focusing on Unreal Engine 5.2 and possibly Hammer by Valve.

June 2024: Ooo and there is still a Tomb Raider level editor. Ya baby! But I recommend [Tomb Engine (TEN)](https://tombengine.com/download/) as it is a more modern platform.
